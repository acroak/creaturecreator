<h2>Struggles</h2>
<p>This project was originally going to use beer APIs, however the data is valuable and the APIs are on locakdown. None of the sites responded to my requests for an educational API. Then I thought Angular and jquery could be friends, unfortunately not. So I had to scrap the full CRUD I had created with Angular and rebuild with a MEN stack with jquery instead of a MEAN stack</p>
